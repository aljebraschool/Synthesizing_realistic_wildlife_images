# Synthesizing Realistic Wildlife Images for Conservation and Education

## Overview

This project addresses the critical issue of data scarcity in wildlife conservation, particularly the lack of imagery for endangered species. By leveraging advanced generative AI techniques, we aim to create realistic wildlife images to support conservation efforts, scientific research, and public awareness.

## Key Features

- Utilizes pre-trained generative models with fine-tuning
- Focuses on endangered African species: African Manatee, African Golden Cat, and White-backed Vulture
- Demonstrates potential for generating images of untrained species

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Images of target species collected from IUCN Red List
2. **Preprocessing**: Images resized to 512x512 pixels
3. **Model**: Fine-tuned runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 using DreamBooth technique
4. **Evaluation**: Generated images compared with real wildlife photos

## Results

- Successfully generated realistic images of trained species
- Demonstrated generalization to untrained species
- Potential applications in conservation education and research visualization
- Access the research work [here]([10.13140/RG.2.2.22698.63686](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/383941645_SYNTHESIZING_REALISTIC_WILDLIFE_IMAGES_FOR_CONSERVATION_AND_EDUCATION?channel=doi&linkId=66e15efd64f7bf7b19a5f69b&showFulltext=true))

## Future Work

- Expand model capabilities to cover more species
- Improve accuracy and consistency of generated images
- Explore integration with other conservation technologies
- Address ethical considerations of AI-generated imagery in scientific contexts
